Political Science in Python

This project will mostly be about reimplementing my [undergraduate dissertation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/grwyfydi6btn0ht/CS380_Michael_Fowlie_Final.pdf?dl=0) in Python with a re-usable library, which can then serve as a basis of further research by myself or others.

## Abstract

It is claimed in (Carey and Hix, 2011) that the trade-off between expected fairness and stability in
election systems is non-linear and that small medium sized District Magnitudes are optimal, based
on outcomes of elections in the real world. Does this apply in general or can this effect be explained
by other factors? We test the hypothesis that the trade-off is non-linear against artificial societies
and across a range of voting systems. We use the Spatial Model, Polya Eggenberger Model and
a preference swapping model and the STV, District Proportional and SM rules. Our results show
clearly that there is non-linearity in this trade-off however the shape of the curve differs greatly
depending on the system we use. We compare these different outcomes under a range of different
undesirability functions that value the properties differently. We find that a District Magnitude
of DM = 3, DM = 8 or DM = 20 is optimal, depending on how the properties are valued with
respect to each other.
